        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three
          rods (or towers) and a number of disks of different sizes which can
          slide onto any rod. Here's a detailed explanation:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Initial Setup: The puzzle begins with all the disks stacked on one
            rod in ascending order of size, with the smallest disk at the top.
            This forms a conical shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Objective: The goal is to move the entire stack to one of the other
            rods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rules:
            <ul>
              <li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>
              <li>
                Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the
                stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty
                rod.
              </li>
              <li>
                A larger disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            History: The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Édouard
            Lucas and first presented in 1883². There's a legend associated with
            it that when monks finish moving a tower of 64 disks according to
            these rules, the end of the world will come¹². This puzzle is a
            classic example of a problem that can be solved using recursion and
            is often used to teach recursive algorithms in computer science¹.
